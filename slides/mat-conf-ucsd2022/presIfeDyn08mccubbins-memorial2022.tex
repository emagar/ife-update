Approach 1---Martin\&Quinn (2002): 

\begin{itemize}

\item For \alert{quarter} $t$: $x_{j,t} \sim \mathrm{N}( x_{j,t-1},\text{slack})$

\item \emph{Drawback}: votes vary considerably across quarters---ideal points sensitive to sheer volume of information (Desposato), so drift may be spurious 

\end{itemize}

Approach 2---Bonica (2010): 

\begin{itemize}

\item Allow estimates to vary over periods of very short duration: item $i \pm k$, $k=15$

% \item<3-> Insincere voting is a problem to infer ideology. \\
% Not a problem if ideal points taken literally (voting record).
